# Senegalese-French-Comparison
This is an analysis on Senegal-French and France-French. 10,000 news articles for each dialect were scraped for comparison between the two.

1) To create Senegal corpus, Run corpus_fun.py
  - the corpus will be saved as corpus.txt, you should edit the name afterward to make sure it doesn't interfere with the France-French corpus. Something like Sen_corpus.txt will do.
  
2) To create France corpus, Run corpus_fra.ipynb

3) Clean both corpora by running the corpus_cleaner.py script in the corpus work folder
 - you will have to match the name of the corpus before running the corpus_cleaner script. Edit the script itself or alter your corpus file name.

4) Corpus analysis is done via the corp_analysis_notebook.ipynb notebook in the corpus analysis folder
